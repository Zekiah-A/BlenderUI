### BlenderUI

`(warning: My first c++ project)`

Blender UI is a ui library intended to emulate the look of blender's user interface. It's implemented in C++, using GLUT and OpenGL for rendering.

It is very simple at the moment.

__Dependencies:__

> `OpenGL headers`

> `GCC / G++ compiler`

You can build the project quickly by running `./build.sh` in the terminal (Linux).
